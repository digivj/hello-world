⦁	Central tendency measures  : 
Mean ,Median , Mode
Mean :Average
Median  :One problem with using the mean, is that it often does not depict the typical outcome.  If there is one outcome that is very far from the rest of the data, then the mean will be strongly affected by this outcome.  Such an outcome is called and outlier.  An alternative measure is the median.  The median is the middle score.  If we have an even number of events we take the average of the two middles.  
 To find the median, the data should be arranged in order from least to greatest. If there is an even number of items in the data set, then the median is found by taking the mean (average) of the two middlemost numbers.
Mode :highest frequency 

⦁	Central Assymetry measures  : is measured as skewness

Variability  measures  :

Variance  : 
Standard Defviation : sqaure root of variance

Coeficient of variation : to brind deviation to the same scale

CoVaraince : used to measure variance for mutiple variables(psitive ,negative or zero).
